## Giraffe example

Freeman et al's example of testing hypotheses about giraffe necks says
that

> the food competition hypothesis predicts that:

> 1. neck length is variable among giraffes;
> 2. neck length in giraffes is heritable;
> 3. giraffes feed high in trees ...

  This is much harder than it seems.

- #1 and #2 are irrelevant because they relate to *ongoing* evolution by
natural selection among giraffes, rather than *past* evolution by
natural selection (which is, I think, what the hypothesis is really about). Furthermore, they *don't actually distinguish between the food-competition and sexual-selection hypotheses*, both of which are about evolution by natural selection

- #3 is more reasonable, but might also relate to more recent changes in
the environment

The text says that the researchers couldn't test heritability because
they couldn't do breeding experiments.  What about observation of
parent/offspring correlations? (It's too bad that we can't test
heritability in humans because breeding experiments are unethical :-) )

## Pasteur example

- did Pasteur ever actually do a single experiment where he used both straight-necked and swan-necked flasks, or is this an idealization? Skimming the relevant material in @waller_fabulous_2005 and @collins_golem_2012 it seems that he did things like *breaking off the neck* off the flask after a few days (and then dropping the neck into the broth), but not clear if he ever did a modern side-by-side experiment ...
