	abstract = {The chimpanzee genome sequence is a long-awaited milestone, providing opportunities to explore primate evolution and genetic contributions to human physiology and disease. Humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor ∼5-7 million years ago (Mya). The difference between the two genomes is actually not ∼1\%, but ∼4\%—comprising ∼35 million single nucleotide differences and ∼90 Mb of insertions and deletions. The challenge is to identify the many evolutionarily, physiologically, and biomedically important differences scattered throughout these genomes while integrating these data with emerging knowledge about the corresponding “phenomes” and the relevant environmental influences. It is logical to tackle the genetic aspects via both genome-wide analyses and candidate gene studies. Genome-wide surveys could eliminate the majority of genomic sequence differences from consideration, while simultaneously identifying potential targets of opportunity. Meanwhile, candidate gene approaches can be based on such genomic surveys, on genes that may contribute to known differences in phenotypes or disease incidence/severity, or on mutations in the human population that impact unique aspects of the human condition. These two approaches will intersect at many levels and should be considered complementary. We also cite some known genetic differences between humans and great apes, realizing that these likely represent only the tip of the iceberg.},

	abstract = {Previous research has identified morphological differences between the brains of Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans ({AMHs}). However, studies using endocasts or the cranium itself are limited to investigating external surface features and the overall size and shape of the brain. A complementary approach uses comparative primate data to estimate the size of internal brain areas. Previous attempts to do this have generally assumed that identical total brain volumes imply identical internal organization. Here, we argue that, in the case of Neanderthals and {AMHs}, differences in the size of the body and visual system imply differences in organization between the same-sized brains of these two taxa. We show that Neanderthals had significantly larger visual systems than contemporary {AMHs} (indexed by orbital volume) and that when this, along with their greater body mass, is taken into account, Neanderthals have significantly smaller adjusted endocranial capacities than contemporary {AMHs}. We discuss possible implications of differing brain organization in terms of social cognition, and consider these in the context of differing abilities to cope with fluctuating resources and cultural maintenance.},

	abstract = {Background Later Pleistocene human evolution in East Asia remains poorly understood owing to a scarcity of well described, reliably classified and accurately dated fossils. Southwest China has been identified from genetic research as a hotspot of human diversity, containing ancient {mtDNA} and Y-{DNA} lineages, and has yielded a number of human remains thought to derive from Pleistocene deposits. We have prepared, reconstructed, described and dated a new partial skull from a consolidated sediment block collected in 1979 from the site of Longlin Cave (Guangxi Province). We also undertook new excavations at Maludong (Yunnan Province) to clarify the stratigraphy and dating of a large sample of mostly undescribed human remains from the site. Methodology/Principal Findings We undertook a detailed comparison of cranial, including a virtual endocast for the Maludong calotte, mandibular and dental remains from these two localities. Both samples probably derive from the same population, exhibiting an unusual mixture of modern human traits, characters probably plesiomorphic for later Homo, and some unusual features. We dated charcoal with {AMS} radiocarbon dating and speleothem with the Uranium-series technique and the results show both samples to be from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition: ∼14.3-11.5 ka. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis suggests two plausible explanations for the morphology sampled at Longlin Cave and Maludong. First, it may represent a late-surviving archaic population, perhaps paralleling the situation seen in North Africa as indicated by remains from Dar-es-Soltane and Temara, and maybe also in southern China at Zhirendong. Alternatively, East Asia may have been colonised during multiple waves during the Pleistocene, with the Longlin-Maludong morphology possibly reflecting deep population substructure in Africa prior to modern humans dispersing into Eurasia.},

However, with the influx of new ideas and scientific traditions from genomics into evolutionary biology, the old adaptionist controversies are being recycled in a new context. The insight gained by evolutionary biologists, that functional differences cannot be equated to adaptive changes, has at times not been appreciated by the genomics community. In this comment, I argue that even in the presence of both functional data and evidence for selection from {DNA} sequence data, it is still difficult to construct strong arguments in favor of adaptation. However, despite the difficulties in establishing scientific arguments in favor of specific historic evolutionary events, there is still much to learn about evolution from genomic data.},

The evidence indicates that some populations of modern humans have received infusions of genes from two different groups of Neanderthals. One of these Neanderthal groups lived in the Middle East and Central Europe and the other group (the Denisovans) is known to have lived in Central Asia and was probably more widespread. This review examines two questions. First, how were these introgressions detected and what does the genetic evidence tell us about their nature and extent? We will see that an unknown but possibly large fraction of the entire Neanderthal gene complement may have survived in modern humans. Even though each modern European and Asian carries only a few percent of genes that can be traced back to Neanderthals, different individuals carry different subgroups of these introgressed genes. Second, what is the likelihood that this Neanderthal genetic legacy has had phenotypic effects on modern humans? We examine evidence for and against the possibility that some of the surviving fragments of Neanderthal genomes have been preserved by natural selection, and we explore the ways in which more evidence bearing on this question will become available in the future.},

	abstract = {Neanderthals were a group of archaic hominins that occupied most of Europe and parts of Western Asia from ∼30,000 to 300,000 years ago ({KYA}). They coexisted with modern humans during part of this time. Previous genetic analyses that compared a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome with genomes of several modern humans concluded that Neanderthals made a small (1-4\%) contribution to the gene pools of all non-African populations. This observation was consistent with a single episode of admixture from Neanderthals into the ancestors of all non-Africans when the two groups coexisted in the Middle East 50-80 {KYA}. We examined the relationship between Neanderthals and modern humans in greater detail by applying two complementary methods to the published draft Neanderthal genome and an expanded set of high-coverage modern human genome sequences. We find that, consistent with the recent finding of Meyer et al. (2012), Neanderthals contributed more {DNA} to modern East Asians than to modern Europeans. Furthermore we find that the Maasai of East Africa have a small but significant fraction of Neanderthal {DNA}. Because our analysis is of several genomic samples from each modern human population considered, we are able to document the extent of variation in Neanderthal ancestry within and among populations. Our results combined with those previously published show that a more complex model of admixture between Neanderthals and modern humans is necessary to account for the different levels of Neanderthal ancestry among human populations. In particular, at least some Neanderthal-modern human admixture must postdate the separation of the ancestors of modern European and modern East Asian populations.},

	abstract = {The timing of Neanderthal disappearance and the extent to which they overlapped with the earliest incoming anatomically modern humans ({AMHs}) in Eurasia are key questions in palaeoanthropology. Determining the spatiotemporal relationship between the two populations is crucial if we are to understand the processes, timing and reasons leading to the disappearance of Neanderthals and the likelihood of cultural and genetic exchange. Serious technical challenges, however, have hindered reliable dating of the period, as the radiocarbon method reaches its limit at [sim]50,000 years ago. Here we apply improved accelerator mass spectrometry 14C techniques to construct robust chronologies from 40 key Mousterian and Neanderthal archaeological sites, ranging from Russia to Spain. Bayesian age modelling was used to generate probability distribution functions to determine the latest appearance date. We show that the Mousterian ended by 41,030-39,260 calibrated years bp (at 95.4\% probability) across Europe. We also demonstrate that succeeding /`transitional/' archaeological industries, one of which has been linked with Neanderthals (Chatelperronian), end at a similar time. Our data indicate that the disappearance of Neanderthals occurred at different times in different regions. Comparing the data with results obtained from the earliest dated {AMH} sites in Europe, associated with the Uluzzian technocomplex, allows us to quantify the temporal overlap between the two human groups. The results reveal a significant overlap of 2,600-5,400 years (at 95.4\% probability). This has important implications for models seeking to explain the cultural, technological and biological elements involved in the replacement of Neanderthals by {AMHs}. A mosaic of populations in Europe during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition suggests that there was ample time for the transmission of cultural and symbolic behaviours, as well as possible genetic exchanges, between the two groups.},

To investigate the genetic history of this mutation in the {AJ} population, a conserved haplotype (D15S981:175–D15S131:240–D15S1050:284–D15S197:144–D15S188:418) was identified in 1278insTATC chromosomes from 55 unrelated {AJ} individuals (15 homozygotes and 40 heterozygotes for the {TSD} mutation), suggesting the occurrence of a common founder. When two methods were used for analysis of linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) between flanking polymorphic markers and the disease locus and for the study of the decay of {LD} over time, the estimated age of the insertion was found to be 40±12 generations (95\% confidence interval: 30–50 generations), so that the most recent common ancestor of the mutation-bearing chromosomes would date to the 8th–9th century. This corresponds with the demographic expansion of {AJs} in central Europe, following the founding of the Ashkenaz settlement in the early Middle Ages. The results are consistent with the geographic distribution of the main {TSD} mutation, 1278insTATC being more common in central Europe, and with the coalescent times of mutations causing two other {LSDs}, Gaucher disease and mucolipidosis type {IV}. Evidence for the absence of a determinant positive selection (heterozygote advantage) over the mutation is provided by a comparison between the estimated age of 1278insTATC and the probability of the current {AJ} frequency of the mutant allele as a function of its age, calculated by use of a branching-process model. Therefore, the founder effect in a rapidly expanding population arising from a bottleneck provides a robust parsimonious hypothesis explaining the spread of 1278insTATC-linked {TSD} in {AJ} individuals.},

A unique gene tree was constructed from 326 sequences of 349 in the total sample. New maximum-likelihood methods for analyzing gene trees on the basis of coalescence theory have been used. The most recent common ancestor of the beta-globin gene tree is a sequence found only in Africa and estimated to have arisen approximately 800,000 years ago. There is no evidence for an exponential expansion out of a bottlenecked founding population, and an effective population size of approximately 10,000 has been maintained. Modest differences in levels of beta-globin diversity between Africa and Asia are better explained by greater African effective population size than by greater time depth. There may have been a reduction of Asian effective population size in recent evolutionary history. Characteristically Asian ancestry is estimated to be older than 200,000 years, suggesting that the ancestral hominid population at this time was widely dispersed across Africa and Asia. Patterns of beta-globin diversity suggest extensive worldwide late Pleistocene gene flow and are not easily reconciled with a unidirectional migration out of Africa 100,000 years ago and total replacement of archaic populations in Asia.},

We hypothesize that all extant world populations of the parasite have recently derived (within several thousand years) from a single ancestral strain. The upper limit of the 95\% confidence interval for the time when this most recent common ancestor lived is between 24,500 and 57,500 years ago (depending on different estimates of the nucleotide substitution rate); the actual time is likely to be much more recent. The recent origin of the P. falciparum populations could have resulted from either a demographic sweep (P. falciparum has only recently spread throughout the world from a small geographically confined population) or a selective sweep (one strain favored by natural selection has recently replaced all others). The selective sweep hypothesis requires that populations of P. falciparum be effectively clonal, despite the obligate sexual stage of the parasite life cycle. A demographic sweep that started several thousand years ago is consistent with worldwide climatic changes ensuing the last glaciation, increased anthropophilia of the mosquito vectors, and the spread of agriculture. P. falciparum may have rapidly spread from its African tropical origins to the tropical and subtropical regions of the world only within the last 6,000 years. The recent origin of the world-wide P. falciparum populations may account for its virulence, as the most malignant of human malarial parasites.},

More than 50 years ago, it was suggested that the gene responsible for this disorder could reach high frequencies because of resistance conferred against malaria by the heterozygous carrier state. This traditional example of balancing selection is known as the 'malaria hypothesis'. However, the geographical relationship between the transmission intensity of malaria and associated {HbS} burden has never been formally investigated on a global scale. Here, we use a comprehensive data assembly of {HbS} allele frequencies to generate the first evidence-based map of the worldwide distribution of the gene in a Bayesian geostatistical framework. We compare this map with the pre-intervention distribution of malaria endemicity, using a novel geostatistical area-mean comparison. We find geographical support for the malaria hypothesis globally; the relationship is relatively strong in Africa but cannot be resolved in the Americas or in Asia.

It is generally believed that its current prevalence in many tropical populations reflects selection for the carrier form (sickle cell trait [{HbAS}]) through a survival advantage against death from malaria. Nevertheless, {\textgreater}50 years after this hypothesis was first proposed, the epidemiological description of the relationships between {HbAS}, malaria, and other common causes of child mortality remains incomplete
{MethodsWe} studied the incidence of falciparum malaria and other childhood diseases in 2 cohorts of children living on the coast of Kenya
{ResultsThe} protective effect of {HbAS} was remarkably specific for falciparum malaria, having no significant impact on any other disease. {HbAS} had no effect on the prevalence of symptomless parasitemia but was 50\% protective against mild clinical malaria, 75\% protective against admission to the hospital for malaria, and almost 90\% protective against severe or complicated malaria. The effect of {HbAS} on episodes of clinical malaria was mirrored in its effect on parasite densities during such episodes

The present authors (Myrianthopoulos and Aronson, 1966) examined several possible mechanisms but found no evidence that differential breeding pattern, genetic drift or differential mutation rate could explain the difference in gene frequency distribution. We then tested the possibility of differential fertility of the heterozygote for the {TSD} gene by comparing the reproductive performance of the grandparents of a large number of Jewish infants affected with {TSD} with that of an appropriate control group. The results suggested that the Jewish {TSD} heterozygote enjoys an overall reproductive advantage of about 6\% over the presumed Jewish homozygous normal and that {TSD} sibships had significantly higher survival to age 21 than did control sibships. This advantage is of more than sufficient magnitude to have raised the frequency of the lethal {TSD} gene among the Ashkenazi Jews from a presumed frequency equal to that of non-Jews of 0.0013 at the end of the first century A.D. when the mass emigration of the Jews began, through 50 generations to the late 19th century, when {TSD} was recognized as occurring chiefly among Ashkenazi Jews with a gene frequency of 0.0126.},

Here, we introduce a framework for detecting the genetic imprint of recent positive selection by analysing long-range haplotypes in human populations. We first identify haplotypes at a locus of interest (core haplotypes). We then assess the age of each core haplotype by the decay of its association to alleles at various distances from the locus, as measured by extended haplotype homozygosity ({EHH}). Core haplotypes that have unusually high {EHH} and a high population frequency indicate the presence of a mutation that rose to prominence in the human gene pool faster than expected under neutral evolution. We applied this approach to investigate selection at two genes carrying common variants implicated in resistance to malaria: G6PD and {CD}40 ligand. At both loci, the core haplotypes carrying the proposed protective mutation stand out and show significant evidence of selection. More generally, the method could be used to scan the entire genome for evidence of recent positive selection.},

In contrast with most complex diseases or traits, the genetic architecture of most Mendelian traits is relatively well established. Most mutations associated with Mendelian disease-related traits are highly penetrant and kept at low population frequencies because of the effects of purifying selection. However, this is not always the case. Here, we review several examples of Mendelian mutations—associated with various disease conditions or other traits of anthropological interest—that have increased in frequency in the human population as a result of past positive selection. These examples clearly illustrate the value of a population genetics approach to unravel the biological mechanisms that have been central to our past and present survival against the selective pressures imposed by diseases and other environmental factors.},

Most adults worldwide do not produce the enzyme lactase and so are unable to digest the milk sugar lactose. However, most people in Europe and many from other populations continue to produce lactase throughout their life (lactase persistence). In Europe, a single genetic variant, −13,910*T, is strongly associated with lactase persistence and appears to have been favoured by natural selection in the last 10,000 years. Since adult consumption of fresh milk was only possible after the domestication of animals, it is likely that lactase persistence coevolved with the cultural practice of dairying, although it is not known when lactase persistence first arose in Europe or what factors drove its rapid spread. To address these questions, we have developed a simulation model of the spread of lactase persistence, dairying, and farmers in Europe, and have integrated genetic and archaeological data using newly developed statistical approaches. We infer that lactase persistence/dairying coevolution began around 7,500 years ago between the central Balkans and central Europe, probably among people of the Linearbandkeramik culture. We also find that lactase persistence was not more favoured in northern latitudes through an increased requirement for dietary vitamin D. Our results illustrate the possibility of integrating genetic and archaeological data to address important questions on human evolution.},

The sudden change of lifestyle with physical inactivity and excessive calorie intake undoubtedly have a major part of the epidemic development; however, some individuals seem to be more prone to be affected by an unhealthy lifestyle than others. Hence, genetic predisposition also has an essential role in determining disease susceptibility and response to lifestyle factors. Since the introduction of genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}), the success of identifying obesity susceptibility variants have increased, and a total of 32 variants have been identified associating genome-wide significantly with body mass index ({BMI}) and 18 with measures of fat distribution during four overall obesity {GWAS} waves. However, the immediate success of the {GWAS} approach has eased off, but the proportion of explained variance for {BMI} by the identified obesity variants remains low. This review suggests and discusses new initiatives to take {GWAS} of obesity to the next level, including gene–environment interactions as modulating/masking factors, low-frequent or rare variants and ways to address such analyses, and finally reflections about the applicability of epigenetic modifications when elucidating the genetic background of obesity.},

	abstract = {Human skin pigmentation is the product of two clines produced by natural selection to adjust levels of constitutive pigmentation to levels of {UV} radiation ({UVR}). One cline was generated by high {UVR} near the equator and led to the evolution of dark, photoprotective, eumelanin-rich pigmentation. The other was produced by the requirement for {UVB} photons to sustain cutaneous photosynthesis of vitamin D₃ in low-{UVB} environments, and resulted in the evolution of depigmented skin. As hominins dispersed outside of the tropics, they experienced different intensities and seasonal mixtures of {UVA} and {UVB}. Extreme {UVA} throughout the year and two equinoctial peaks of {UVB} prevail within the tropics. Under these conditions, the primary selective pressure was to protect folate by maintaining dark pigmentation. Photolysis of folate and its main serum form of 5-methylhydrofolate is caused by {UVR} and by reactive oxygen species generated by {UVA}. Competition for folate between the needs for cell division, {DNA} repair, and melanogenesis is severe under stressful, high-{UVR} conditions and is exacerbated by dietary insufficiency. Outside of tropical latitudes, {UVB} levels are generally low and peak only once during the year. The populations exhibiting maximally depigmented skin are those inhabiting environments with the lowest annual and summer peak levels of {UVB}. Development of facultative pigmentation (tanning) was important to populations settling between roughly 23° and 46°, where levels of {UVB} varied strongly according to season. Depigmented and tannable skin evolved numerous times in hominin evolution via independent genetic pathways under positive selection.},

	abstract = {Background:
The genes coding for ethanol metabolism enzymes [alcohol dehydrogenase ({ADH}) and aldehyde dehydrogenase ({ALDH})] have been widely studied for their influence on the risk to develop alcohol dependence ({AD}). However, the relation between polymorphisms of these metabolism genes and {AD} in Caucasian subjects has not been clearly established. The present study examined evidence for the association of alcohol metabolism genes with {AD} in the Irish Affected Sib Pair Study of alcohol dependence.

Methods:
We conducted a case–control association study with 575 independent subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, {AD} diagnosis and 530 controls. A total of 77 single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in the seven {ADH} ({ADH}1-7) and two {ALDH} genes ({ALDH}1A1 and {ALDH}2) were genotyped using the Illumina {GoldenGate} protocols. Several statistical procedures were implemented to control for false discoveries.

Results:
All markers with minor allele frequency greater than 0.01 were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Numerous {SNPs} in {ADH} genes showed association with {AD}, including one marker in the coding region of {ADH}1C (rs1693482 in exon6, Ile271Gln). Haplotypic association was observed in the {ADH}5 and {ADH}1C genes, and in a long haplotype block formed by the {ADH}1A and {ADH}1B loci. We detected two significant interactions between pairs of markers in intron 6 of {ADH}6 and intron 12 of {ALDH}2 (p = 5 × 10−5), and 5′ of both {ADH}4 and {ADH}1A (p = 2 × 10−4).

Conclusion:
We found evidence for the association of several {ADH} genes with {AD} in a sample of Western European origin. The significant interaction effects between markers in {ADH} and {ALDH} genes suggest possible epistatic roles between alcohol metabolic enzymes in the risk for {AD}.},

Approximately 50\% of East Asians have genetic variants that significantly impair this pathway and influence alcohol dependence ({AD}) vulnerability. We investigated whether variation in alcohol metabolism genes might alter the {AD} risk in four non-East Asian populations by performing systematic haplotype association analyses to maximize the chances of capturing functional variation. Methods:  Haplotype-tagging {SNPs} were genotyped using the Illumina {GoldenGate} platform. Genotypes were available for 40 {SNPs} across the {ADH} genes cluster and 24 {SNPs} across the two {ALDH} genes in four diverse samples that included cases (lifetime {AD}) and controls (no Axis 1 disorders). The case control sample sizes were the following: Finnish Caucasians: 232, 194; African Americans: 267, 422; Plains American Indians: 226, 110; and Southwestern American ({SW}) Indians: 317, 72. Results:  In all four populations, as well as {HapMap} populations, 5 haplotype blocks were identified across the {ADH} gene cluster: (i) {ADH}5-{ADH}4; (ii) {ADH}6-{ADH}1A-{ADH}1B; (iii) {ADH}1C; (iv) intergenic; (v) {ADH}7. The {ALDH}1A1 gene was defined by 4 blocks and {ALDH}2 by 1 block. No haplotype or {SNP} association results were significant after correction for multiple comparisons; however, several results, particularly for {ALDH}1A1 and {ADH}4, replicated earlier findings. There was an {ALDH}1A1 block 1 and 2 (extending from intron 5 to the 3′ {UTR}) yin yang haplotype (haplotypes that have opposite allelic configuration) association with {AD} in the Finns driven by {SNPs} rs3764435 and rs2303317, respectively, and an {ALDH}1A1 block 3 (including the promoter region) yin yang haplotype association in {SW} Indians driven by 5 {SNPs}, all in allelic identity. The {ADH}4 {SNP} rs3762894 was associated with {AD} in Plains Indians. Conclusions:  The systematic evaluation of alcohol-metabolizing genes in four non-East Asian populations has shown only modest associations with {AD}, largely for {ALDH}1A1 and {ADH}4. A concentration of signals for {AD} with {ALDH}1A1 yin yang haplotypes in several populations warrants further study.},

We examined microsatellite variation around the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene on chromosome 4 of P. falciparum. Point mutations in dhfr are known to be responsible for resistance to the antimalarial drug pyrimethamine, and resistance to this drug has spread rapidly in Southeast ({SE}) Asia after its introduction in 1970s. We genotyped 33 microsatellite markers distributed across chromosome 4 in 61 parasites from a location on the Thailand/Myanmar border. We observed minimal microsatellite length variation in a 12-kb (0.7-{cM}) region flanking the dhfr gene and diminished variation for approximately 100 kb (6 {cM}), indicative of a single origin of resistant alleles. Furthermore, we found the same or similar microsatellite haplotypes flanked resistant dhfr alleles sampled from 11 parasite populations in five {SE} Asian countries indicating recent invasion of a single lineage of resistant dhfr alleles in locations 2,000 km apart. Three features of these data are of especial interest. (1) Pyrimethamine resistance is generally assumed to have evolved multiple times because the genetic basis is simple and resistance can be selected easily in the laboratory. Yet our data clearly indicate a single origin of resistant dhfr alleles sampled over a large region of {SE} Asia. (2) The wide valley (∼6 {cM}) of reduced variation around dhfr provides “proof-of-principle” that genome-wide association may be an effective way to locate genes under strong recent selection. (3) The width of the selective valley is consistent with predictions based on independent measures of recombination, mutation, and selection intensity, suggesting that we have reasonable estimates of these parameters. We conclude that scanning the malaria parasite genome for evidence of recent selection may prove an extremely effective way to locate genes underlying recently evolved traits such as drug resistance, as well as providing an opportunity to study the dynamics of selective events that have occurred recently or are currently in progress.},

The scientific research leading to {BiDil}’s approval tested the drug only in African American populations, apparently for commercial reasons, so the drug’s efficacy in other populations is unknown. Race as a biological-medical construct is increasingly controversial; {BiDil} offers a good example of how sociocultural factors in disease causation may be overlooked as a result of an overly simplistic assumption of a racial and hence presumed genetic difference. Past discrimination and present disparities in health care involving African American patients are serious concerns, and we must welcome a treatment that promises to benefit a previously underserved group; yet the negative aspects of {BiDil} and the process that led to its discovery and marketing set an unfortunate precedent. Primary care physicians should be aware of possible generic equivalents that will affect the availability of this drug for low-income or uninsured patients.},

	volume = {4},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005174},
	abstract = {The kings of the Spanish Habsburg dynasty (1516–1700) frequently married close relatives in such a way that uncle-niece, first cousins and other consanguineous unions were prevalent in that dynasty. In the historical literature, it has been suggested that inbreeding was a major cause responsible for the extinction of the dynasty when the king Charles {II}, physically and mentally disabled, died in 1700 and no children were born from his two marriages, but this hypothesis has not been examined from a genetic perspective. In this article, this hypothesis is checked by computing the inbreeding coefficient (F) of the Spanish Habsburg kings from an extended pedigree up to 16 generations in depth and involving more than 3,000 individuals. The inbreeding coefficient of the Spanish Habsburg kings increased strongly along generations from 0.025 for king Philip I, the founder of the dynasty, to 0.254 for Charles {II} and several members of the dynasty had inbreeding coefficients higher than 0.20. In addition to inbreeding due to unions between close relatives, ancestral inbreeding from multiple remote ancestors makes a substantial contribution to the inbreeding coefficient of most kings. A statistically significant inbreeding depression for survival to 10 years is detected in the progenies of the Spanish Habsburg kings. The results indicate that inbreeding at the level of first cousin (F = 0.0625) exerted an adverse effect on survival of 17.8\%±12.3. It is speculated that the simultaneous occurrence in Charles {II} (F = 0.254) of two different genetic disorders: combined pituitary hormone deficiency and distal renal tubular acidosis, determined by recessive alleles at two unlinked loci, could explain most of the complex clinical profile of this king, including his impotence/infertility which in last instance led to the extinction of the dynasty.},

This hierarchical model consists of two multinomial trials: one of the sampling process of the parents from the population of interest, and the other for the survival of the offspring of the families obtained by mating the parents. The method, initially developed for selfing and full-sib mating, is extended here to include more general mating systems as well as mixtures of mating systems. We applied it to human data sets for which confidence intervals were previously not available. Our point estimates were close to previous ones, and the standard deviations were generally quite small. Thus, even if debate over the meaning of the concept of lethal equivalents has not been entirely resolved, our results showed that the previous estimates are at least statistically meaningful.},

	abstract = {We used network-based diffusion analysis to reveal the cultural spread of a naturally occurring foraging innovation, lobtail feeding, through a population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) over a period of 27 years. Support for models with a social transmission component was 6 to 23 orders of magnitude greater than for models without. The spatial and temporal distribution of sand lance, a prey species, was also important in predicting the rate of acquisition. Our results, coupled with existing knowledge about song traditions, show that this species can maintain multiple independently evolving traditions in its populations. These insights strengthen the case that cetaceans represent a peak in the evolution of nonhuman culture, independent of the primate lineage. Animal Culture Cultural transmission of information occurs when individuals learn from others with more experience or when individuals come to accept particular modes of behavior as the local norm. Such information transfer can be expected in highly social or long-lived species where contact and time for learning are maximized and are seen in humans (see the Perspective by de Waal). Using a network-based diffusion analysis on a long-term data set that includes tens of thousands of observations of individual humpback whales, Allen et al. (p. 485) show that an innovative feeding behavior has spread through social transmission since it first emerged in a single individual in 1980. The “lobtail” feeding has passed among associating individuals for more than three decades. Van de Waal et al. (p. 483), on the other hand, used a controlled experimental approach in vervet monkeys to show that individuals learn what to eat from more experienced individuals within their social group. Not only did young animals learn from observing older animals, but immigrating males switched their food preference to that of their new group.},

Grandmothers׳ help would allow mothers to give birth to subsequent offspring sooner without risking the survival of existing offspring. Our model is an agent-based model ({ABM}), in which the population evolves according to probabilistic rules governing interactions among individuals. The model is formulated according to the Gillespie algorithm of determining the times to next events. Grandmother effects drive the population from an equilibrium representing a great-ape-like average adult lifespan in the lower twenties to a new equilibrium with a human-like average adult lifespan in the lower forties.

The stochasticity of the {ABM} allows the possible coexistence of two locally-stable equilibria, corresponding to great-ape-like and human-like lifespans. Populations with grandmothering that escape the ancestral condition then shift to human-like lifespan, but the transition takes longer than previous models (Kim et al., 2012). Our simulations are consistent with the possibility that distinctive longevity is a feature of genus Homo that long antedated the appearance of our species.},

The most common species, Lamellibrachia sp., grows very slowly (averaging 0.77 cm. a-1) and yet commonly reaches lengths over 2 m. Based on conservative calculations we conclude that individuals in mature aggregations are a minimum of 100 a old and are likely to be much older. Smaller numbers of a second species of vestimentiferan (related to escarpids) were also monitored over this period. We consider it likely that the individuals of the second species banded for this study were already on the plateau of their growth curve, and that the very low average growth rates recorded here would lead to an overestimate of the ages of the individuals used in this study. However, life history considerations combined with the extremely low measured growth rates of this species suggest it is also long-lived.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen is a key element controlling the species composition, diversity, dynamics, and functioning of many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Many of the original plant species living in these ecosystems are adapted to, and function optimally in, soils and solutions with low levels of available nitrogen. The growth and dynamics of herbivore populations, and ultimately those of their predators, also are affected by N. Agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and other human activities have altered the global cycle of N substantially, generally increasing both the availability and the mobility of N over large regions of Earth. The mobility of N means that while most deliberate applications of N occur locally, their influence spreads regionally and even globally. Moreover, many of the mobile forms of N themselves have environmental consequences. Although most nitrogen inputs serve human needs such as agricultural production, their environmental consequences are serious and long term. Based on our review of available scientific evidence, we are certain that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: 					approximately doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, with these rates still increasing;increased concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas N2O globally, and increased concentrations of other oxides of nitrogen that drive the formation of photochemical smog over large regions of Earth;caused losses of soil nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, that are essential for the long-term maintenance of soil fertility;contributed substantially to the acidification of soils, streams, and lakes in several regions; andgreatly increased the transfer of nitrogen through rivers to estuaries and coastal oceans.In addition, based on our review of available scientific evidence we are confident that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: 					increased the quantity of organic carbon stored within terrestrial ecosystems;accelerated losses of biological diversity, especially losses of plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen, and losses of the animals and microorganisms that depend on them; andcaused changes in the composition and functioning of estuarine and nearshore ecosystems, and contributed to long-term declines in coastal marine fisheries.},

Cooperation is most difficult to explain in the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, where cooperators always lose in direct competition with defectors despite increasing mean fitness [ 1, 4, 5 ]. Here we demonstrate how spatial population expansion, a widespread natural phenomenon [ 6–11 ], promotes the evolution of cooperation. We engineer an experimental Prisoner’s Dilemma game in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that, despite losing to defectors in nonexpanding conditions, cooperators increase in frequency in spatially expanding populations. Fluorescently labeled colonies show genetic demixing [ 8 ] of cooperators and defectors, followed by increase in cooperator frequency as cooperator sectors overtake neighboring defector sectors. Together with lattice-based spatial simulations, our results suggest that spatial population expansion drives the evolution of cooperation by (1) increasing positive genetic assortment at population frontiers and (2) selecting for phenotypes maximizing local deme productivity. Spatial expansion thus creates a selective force whereby cooperator-enriched demes overtake neighboring defector-enriched demes in a “survival of the fastest.” We conclude that colony growth alone can promote cooperation and prevent defection in microbes. Our results extend to other species with spatially restricted dispersal undergoing range expansion, including pathogens, invasive species, and humans.},

These questions are of global importance because of the vast quantities of organic carbon stored in permafrost soils. In this meta-analysis, we compile 40 years of {CO2} flux observations from 54 studies spanning 32 sites across northern high latitudes. Using time-series analysis, we investigated if seasonal or annual {CO2} fluxes have changed over time, and whether spatial differences in mean annual temperature could help explain temporal changes in {CO2} flux. Growing season net {CO2} uptake has definitely increased since the 1990s; the data also suggest (albeit less definitively) an increase in winter {CO2} emissions, especially in the last decade. In spite of the uncertainty in the winter trend, we estimate that tundra sites were annual {CO2} sources from the mid-1980s until the 2000s, and data from the last 7 years show that tundra continue to emit {CO2} annually. {CO2} emissions exceed {CO2} uptake across the range of temperatures that occur in the tundra biome. Taken together, these data suggest that despite increases in growing season uptake, tundra ecosystems are currently {CO2} sources on an annual basis.},

	abstract = {The dispersal and migration of organisms have resulted in the colonisation of nearly every possible habitat and ultimately the extraordinary diversity of life. Animal dispersal tendencies are commonly heterogeneous (e.g. long vs. short) and non-random suggesting that phenotypic and genotypic variability between individuals can contribute to population-level heterogeneity in dispersal. Using laboratory and field experiments, we demonstrate that natural allelic variation in a gene underlying a foraging polymorphism in larval fruit flies (for), also influences their dispersal tendencies as adults. Rover flies ({forR}; higher foraging activity) have consistently greater dispersal tendencies and are more likely to disperse longer distances than sitter flies (fors; lower foraging activity). Increasing for expression in the brain and nervous system increases dispersal in sitter flies. Our study supports the notion that variation in dispersal can be driven by intrinsic variation in food-dependent search behaviours and confirms that single gene pleiotropic effects can contribute to population-level heterogeneity in dispersal.},

The difference between "rovers" and "sitters" was analyzed genetically by chromosomal substitutions between isogenic stocks. Differences in larval locomotor behavior ("crawling behavior") can be attributed to the second chromosome, the "rover" strategy being dominant over the "sitter" strategy. Differences in feeding rate ("shoveling behavior") are affected additively by both the second and third chromosomes. Natural populations of Drosophila larvae were sampled three times over a 2-month period; "rovers" and "sitters" were at constant frequencies in these populations. The two foraging strategies are discussed in the light of resource utilization in environments where food is distributed continuously or discontinuously.},

I tested their model for single-prey loading species (those that carry items singly) with a natural population of white-fronted bee-eaters (Merops bullockoides) in Kenya. These insectivorous birds breed in colonies but defend nearby foraging territories from which they gather food for their nestlings. Qualitatively, two predictions of the model were upheld: as travel time increased, birds carried larger insects to their nests and spent longer periods of time foraging. Also, as distance increased, birds were increasingly selective of which insects they ate versus carried to the colony. Quantitative comparisons were also made using observed travel times and rates of insect capture. As distance increased, (1) the observed sizes of insects carried approached the values predicted by the Orians-Pearson model, (2) observed foraging times diverged from the predicted values, and (3) birds spent more time foraging between round trips in a relatively unprofitable area near the colony. These results are examined in light of the theory of central place foraging.},

	abstract = {Theories of ecological diversification make predictions about the timing and ordering of character state changes through history. These theories are testable by 'reconstructing' ancestor states using phylogenetic trees and measurements of contemporary species. Here we use maximum likelihood to estimate and evaluate the accuracy of ancestor reconstructions. We present likelihoods of discrete ancestor states and derive probability distributions for continuous ancestral traits. The methods are applied to several examples: diets of ancestral Darwin's finches; origin of inquilinism in gall wasps; microhabitat partitioning and body size evolution in scrubwrens; digestive enzyme evolution in artiodactyl mammals; origin of a sexually selected male trait, the sword, in platies and swordtails; and evolution of specialization in Anolis lizards. When changes between discrete character states are rare, the maximumlikelihood results are similar to parsimony estimates. In this case the accuracy of estimates is often high, with the exception of some nodes deep in the tree. If change is frequent then reconstructions are highly uncertain, especially of distant ancestors. Ancestor states for continuous traits are typically highly uncertain. We conclude that measures of uncertainty are useful and should always be provided, despite simplistic assumptions about the probabilistic models that underlie them. If uncertainty is too high, reconstruction should be abandoned in favor of approaches that fit different models of trait evolution to species data and phylogenetic trees, taking into account the range of ancestor states permitted by the data.},

However, many hosts support mutualist guilds, and interactions among mutualists make the prediction of aggregate effects difficult. Here, we apply a factorial experiment to interactions of ‘guard’ crustaceans that defend their coral host from seastar predators. Predation was reduced by the presence of mutualists (15\% reduction in predation frequency and 45\% in volume of coral consumed). The frequency of attacks with both mutualists was lower than with a single species, but it did not differ significantly from the expected frequency of independent effects. In contrast, the combined defensive efficacy of both mutualist species reduced the volume of coral tissue lost by 73\%, significantly more than the 38\% reduction expected from independent defensive efforts, suggesting the existence of a cooperative synergy in defensive behaviors of ‘guard’ crustaceans. These emergent ‘multiple defender effects’ are statistically and ecologically analogous to the emergent concept of ‘multiple predator effects’ known from the predation literature.},

	title = {The evolutionary response of predators to dangerous prey: Hotspots and coldspots in the geographic mosaic of coevolution between garter snakes and newts},
	volume = {56},
	abstract = {The "geographic mosaic" approach to understanding coevolution is predicated on the existence of variable selection across the landscape of an interaction between species. A range of ecological factors, from diﬀerences in resource availability to diﬀerences in community composition, can generate such a mosaic of selection among populations, and thereby diﬀerences in the strength of coevolution. The result is a mixture of hotspots, where reciprocal selection is strong, and coldspots, where reciprocal selection is weak or absent, throughout the ranges of species. Population subdivision further provides the opportunity for nonadaptive forces, including gene ﬂow, drift, and metapopulation dynamics, to inﬂuence the coevolutionary interaction between species. Some predicted results of this geographic mosaic of coevolution include maladapted or mismatched phenotypes, maintenance of high levels of polymorphism, and prevention of stable equilibrium trait combinations. To evaluate the potential for the geographic mosaic to inﬂuence predator-prey coevolution, we investigated the geographic pattern of genetically determined {TTX} resistance in the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis over much of the range of its ecological interaction with toxic newts of genus Taricha. We assayed {TTX} resistance in over 2900 garter snakes representing 333 families from 40 populations throughout western North America. Our results provide dramatic evidence that geographic structure is an important component in coevolutionary interactions between predators and prey. Resistance levels vary substantially (over three orders of magnitude) among populations and over short distances. The spatial array of variation is consistent with two areas of intense evolutionary response by predators ("hotspots") surrounded by clines of decreasing resistance. Some general predictions of the geographic mosaic process are supported, including clinal variation in phenotypes, polymorphism in some populations, and divergent outcomes of the interaction between predator and prey. Conversely, our data provide little support for one of the major predictions, mismatched values of interacting traits. Two lines of evidence suggest selection is paramount in determining population variation in resistance. First, phylogenetic information indicates that two hotspots of {TTX} resistance have evolved independently. Second, in the one region that {TTX} levels in prey have been quantiﬁed, resistance and toxicity levels match almost perfectly over a wide phenotypic and geographic range. However, these results do not preclude the role the nonadaptive forces in generating the overall geographic mosaic of {TTX} resistance. Much work remains to ﬁll in the geographic pattern of variation among prey populations and, just as importantly, to explore the variation in the ecology of the interaction that occurs within populations.},
