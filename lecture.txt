==============

Intro unit should take a little less than two periods (or a little more than two with IA introduction).

Ended week at:
* End of section (morning)
	* first syllogism slide
* Developmental homologies (afternoon)

Post: fruit fly links

Start with:
* Car trouble
* Fruit fly clarification

2023 Sep 11 (Mon)
=================

Ended Tuesday:
* Why do we acclimate?
* Mouse-breeding activity

Finished U2 right in the middle of W2. So 3.5 periods

... what??

2023 Sep 18 (Mon)
=================

Ended Tuesday in the middle of types of selection
* Slow in the afternoon

Afternoon is getting _way_ behind, maybe kill some time with morning people and pukeko

It looks like U3 currently takes ~2.5 periods. Could aim to use W3 for it? Stretch it out a bit? Intro phylo?

* morning on rings of populations
* afternoon right at beginning of U4.

Afternoon ready for dispersla

2018 

intro: 2 periods

ns: 2.7 periods

St. Louis 1 period

processes: ~3.5 periods

speciation: 2.5 periods
	Add activities!

phylogeny: 0.3 periods 2018 Oct 03 (Wed)

apes: xx periods

Hom and hom: xx periods

review and tech: xx periods

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to rethink, esp. at end. Original plan was probably 1 unit for 9-10, 1 for 11-12, but I apparently did a whole unit on 9, maybe by accident, but it kind of worked.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2017

intro: 1.5 periods

ns: 2 periods

processes: 2.5 periods

speciation: 2.0 periods (or a little less, beef it up a bit)

phylogeny: 3.0 periods 

apes: 2.2 periods

Hom and hom 2.8 periods

review and tech: 2 periods
