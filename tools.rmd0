# evidence about evolution

## kinds of evidence

<#b2cols>

- morphology (fossils)
- morphology (extant species)
- stratigraphy, absolute dating methods
- genetic variation (phylogenetics)

Other ideas?

<#pause>

<#finalhandout

- geological/biogeographical information
- fossils of other species  
(environment, diet)
- trace fossils

## Studying behaviour

- evidence from fossils, <#gloss tools>
- attempts to learn from extant hunter-gatherer groups
    - how much have we evolved?
	- how different is the environment?

## Time scales

<#b2cols>

- First hominins: $\\approx 6$ mya
- First *Homo*: $\\approx 2.8$ mya
- Neanderthals: $\\approx$ 400 kya - 30 kya
- modern humans (*H. sapiens sapiens*): $\\approx  300$ kya - present, in Europe $\\approx 55$ kya

# tools

## The extended phenotype

<#b2cols>

- behaviour (including material culture) is partly genetic
- the <#gloss extended phenotype> is the material structures created
(indirectly) by an organism's genes
- part of biological evolution

- <#gloss social learning>: transmission of behaviour from one individual to another
    - <#gloss social facilitation>:  
living in an environment that facilitates learning
    - <#gloss observational learning>:  
information transmission [@allen_networkbased_2013]
    - <#gloss teaching>: teacher's behaviour changes

## Tool making

- Several species can make tools, but only people make tools that can project
lectures directly from a computer onto a screen (!!)
- More broadly, hominins make fancier tools than non-hominins do

## Other species

- What other animals use and/or make <#gloss tools>?
- Modified objects
- Not counting programmed behaviours (e.g. ant traps)

<#finalhandout
<#pause>

   - Chimpanzees, orangutans
   - Elephants
   - Crows
   - Otters [@mann_tool_2013]
   - Dolphins
   - Bears?? [@deecke_tool-use_2012]

## Oldowan tools

- We find *amazing* stone tools from 2.6-1.7 mya
      - <#gloss Oldowan tools>
- It's hard to know who made them and used them  
      - *Australopithecus*? *Homo*?
      - butchering, digging, weapons?
- Why might we be missing evidence of earlier tool use?	
<#finalhandout
<#pause>

    - Stone keeps better than other materials (bone, wood, ...)

## Acheulean tools

<#b2cols>

- 1.6 mya - 300 kya
- Acheulean industry lasted almost 1 million years
- may have outlasted the species (*H. ergaster*) that started it
- It took people longer to move on from Acheulean industry than to move from
Acheulean industry to self-driving cars!

## Mousterian tools (Neanderthal)

<#b2cols>

- 300 kya - 40 kya
- made by Neanderthals
- hafted weapons?
- pigments and beads 115 kya
- images/representational art $\\approx 65$ kya (Spain)
- other European art  
$\\approx$ 40 kya;  
*could* be Neanderthal ... [@higham_timing_2014;@pike_u-series_2012]

<#s2cols>

<#nohandout <#stdfig bmbpix/mousterian.jpg>>
<#e2cols>

## Modern human tools

- 40 kya - 10 kya
- lots more (better preserved?), more diverse materials
- more representational art (cave paintings, sculptures)

## clicker question

Which one of the following statements is true?

a. humans are the only primates that use tools
b. primates are the only animals that use tools
c. human tool use is probably older than the earliest tools we have found
d. genetic data provides clear evidence of the timing of human tool use
e. *Homo sapiens* was the first species to make stone tools

>

# fire, hunting/scavenging, meat-eating

## fire and cooking

- hard to figure out timing of first use
- burned bones, baked earth
    - from natural fires or campfires?
- earliest **known** controlled fire: 1 mya: caves, South Africa
- did hominins cook (meat or tubers)?
     - could have been an important advantage

## Evidence of meat-eating

- tools and bones
- bones: tooth marks, tool marks
- very hard to tell *why* a pile of animal bones is in a certain area
	 - who killed them?
     - who brought the bones there?
	 - were the bones there before or after the humans?


## Chewing biomechanics

- jaw morphology: *Homo* jaws < ancestors (Australopithecine), relatives (other apes)
- MYH16 gene: makes jaw myosin; $\\approx$ 2.4 mya

## Scavenging

- <#gloss scavenging> is eating meat that is found, or taken from predators

<#nohandout <#medhtfig norton/ch11/11_19a.jpg>>

## Human scavenging

- Evidence of early hominins <#gloss butchering> large animals including elephants: were they hunting or scavenging?

<#pause>

- It's not easy to kill an elephant
    - Could they have had techniques or tools we don't know about?

## Scavenging and hunting

- Scavenging and hunting are complementary activities
    - Most hunters scavenge
    - Most mammalian scavengers hunt
- Our ancestors probably did both
- Scavenging requires the ability to:
    - Take kills from other predators, or
    - Use resources others can't use

## Tools for scavenging and hunting

- Some tools may have been used as weapons
    - For killing prey, or for fighting off other carnivores
    - (There is no evidence of this!)
- Tools could be used to process leftovers
<#finalhandout
<#pause>

    - Cracking large bones for marrow, for example
>

## Parasites 

<#b2cols>

- surprising source of evidence
- molecular phylogeny suggests two human tapeworms (*Taenia*) speciated from each other $\\approx$ 1 mya
- suggests that humans were already the host
- ... so were eating lots of meat

# complex foraging

## tools for complex foraging

Tools and knowledge can make a wide range of food sources available (not just meat)
<#finalhandout
<#pause>

- Colonial insect resources
- Deeply buried plant resources
- Poisonous things that can be processed
>

##  Complex foraging

A key part of human evolution was shaped by <#gloss complex foraging>
strategies of our ancestors -- they relied on many types of food,
including types of food that are difficult to get or process

- What adaptations likely favored this strategy?
<#finalhandout
<#pause>

     - Clever hands, upright walking, tools

- what further adaptations might this strategy have favored?
<#pause>

    - Reduced jaw size
	- Big brains
    - Co-operation, including male-female co-operation
    - Social behaviour
>

## food types

- <#gloss collected>: gathered from the environment (fruit, leaves)
- <#gloss extracted>: gathered and processed:  
nuts, tubers, honey, plants with toxins, termites ...
- <#gloss hunted>

## environment of evolutionary adaptation
<#b2cols>

- <#gloss environment of evolutionary adaptation>
<#pause>
    - the relevant environment for understanding adaptations
- organisms are adapted to their *ancestors'* environments
- do we still act like <#gloss hunter-gatherers> ?
- are current-day H/G good models?

## Complex foraging and co-operation

complex foraging ...

- promotes male-female co-operation, since primate child care is not well suited to a hunting life style
- promotes co-operation between people with different
skills, since they might have access to food at different times
- promotes co-operation among hunters, since hunting success is
highly variable
- promotes co-operation in teaching and learning

## Complex foraging and thinking

- Complex foraging favors large brains that can learn a lot
- it also favors a long learning period
     - Ach√© (Paraguayan): men are best hunters at age 35
     - Hiwi (Venezuela): women are most efficient digging tubers at 35-45
- it also favors communication

## hunting vs. gathering

<#stdfig norton/ch11/11_07.jpg>

## hunting vs. gathering

- balance is controversial
- is our sample biased?
- are modern hunter-gatherers representative of the environment of evolutionary adaptation?
- gender politics ...
- science is <#gloss descriptive>, not <#gloss normative>

## male vs female contributions

<#stdfig norton/ch11/11_11.jpg>

## Active science

- Scientists have lived with, and attempted to learn from, remaining forage-based
societies
    - Skills are very detailed, and take a long time to develop
    - Possible support for looping with culture and language
- What can we learn from modern humans about our ancestors?
<#finalhandout
<#pause>

   - It's complicated
   - A lot of evolution has happened since then, and it's hard to figure out which parts are how relevant
>

<#finalhandout

## clicker question

Which of the following is the best-supported scientific statement?

a. our evolutionary history shows that males should take more responsibility for family support in modern, developed societies
b. females contribute the most calories in most modern hunter-gatherer societies
c. our closest ancestors were solitary hunters and gatherers
d. tools and social learning are useful for both hunting and extraction
e. chimpanzees get most of their food by hunting

# clothing and lice

## clothing

- obvious difference between humans and other primates: hairlessness
- when?
- when did clothing (extended phenotype) "evolve"?
- KRTHAP1 gene: hairlessness, $\\approx$ 240 kya

## lice

<#b2cols>

- lice are <#gloss obligate> parasites: need hair or clothing to survive
- head lice/body lice (*Pediculus*): closest to chimp lice (6 mya)
- pubic lice (*Pthirus pubis*): closest to gorilla lice (split 3-4 mya)

<#pause>

   - implies lateral jump 
- head/body lice **not** separate species (but split $\\approx$ 72 kya): clothing?

<#s2cols>

## a tale of two lineages [@reed_genetic_2004]

<#b2cols>

- two separate, older lineages of *P. humanus*
- split $\\approx$ 1.2 mya
- suggests close contact between archaic and modern humans (!)

##  Summary

- People evolved by the same basic rules as other organisms
<#finalhandout
<#pause>

    - Adaptation by natural selection
>

- Followed a very different path
<#finalhandout
<#pause>

    - Strong loops that created new adaptive opportunities:
upright posture, hands, brains, fire, tools, cooperation, communication,
>
- We can learn a lot about ourselves from biology
<#finalhandout
<#pause>

	- We are affected by all of the same basic processes as other organisms
>
- And also a lot that we can't learn
<#finalhandout
<#pause>

   - We are also strongly affected by our complex brains (and complex cultures)
