I will try to provide suggested readings, mostly from the textbook. These are shown in the notes, but usually not in the slides. They can refer to a figure, a section, or a subsection. When a figure is suggested, you should read the text discussion of the figure (in addition to the figure caption and the figure itself).

The suggested readings for the intro unit are: Fig 1.9; Fig 1.10; Fig 1.7; Fig 1.8; Sec 1.1; Fig 1.2; Fig 1.3. You should be able to find these in the lecture notes.

It may work for you to read the textbook before or after the corresponding lecture. Or both.
